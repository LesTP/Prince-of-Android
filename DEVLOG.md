# DEVLOG — Prince of Persia Android Port

## Phase 0: Environment Setup

### 2026-03-14 — Phase 0 Complete

**Objective:** Clone SDLPoP, set up build environment, verify game runs, obtain test replay.

**What happened:**
1. Cloned SDLPoP from https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP
2. Installed MSYS2 via winget
3. Installed MinGW toolchain: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image make`
4. Discovered pkg-config missing — installed `mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf`
5. Built with `make all` — compiled all 20 source files, linked to prince.exe (1.08 MB)
6. Copied 30 DLLs from /mingw64/bin (SDL2_image has extensive codec dependencies)
7. Verified game launches and plays Level 1
8. Recorded first replay: `first run.p1r`

**DLLs required (discovered incrementally via missing DLL errors):**

Core SDL2:
- SDL2.dll
- SDL2_image.dll

MinGW runtime:
- libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
- libstdc++-6.dll
- libwinpthread-1.dll

Image format codecs:
- libpng16-16.dll
- libjpeg-8.dll
- libtiff-6.dll
- libwebp-7.dll
- libwebpdemux-2.dll
- libgiflib (not needed — static?)

JPEG XL (libjxl) chain:
- libjxl.dll
- libjxl_cms.dll
- liblcms2-2.dll
- libbrotlicommon.dll
- libbrotlidec.dll
- libbrotlienc.dll
- libhwy.dll

AVIF/AV1 chain:
- libavif-16.dll
- libaom.dll
- libdav1d-7.dll
- librav1e.dll
- libSvtAv1Enc-4.dll
- libyuv.dll
- libsharpyuv-0.dll

Compression:
- zlib1.dll
- libzstd.dll
- liblzma-5.dll
- libdeflate.dll
- libjbig-0.dll
- libLerc.dll

**Artifacts:**
- `SDLPoP/prince.exe` — working build
- `SDLPoP/replays/first run.p1r` — test replay

**Lessons learned (promoted to DEVPLAN Gotchas):**
- SDL2_image on Windows/MinGW requires ~30 DLLs for full codec support
- pkg-config must be installed separately from SDL2
- MSYS2 PATH needs both /mingw64/bin and /usr/bin

**Time:** ~45 minutes (including DLL troubleshooting)
